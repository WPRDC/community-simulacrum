            The Childrenâ€™s Health Data Explorer presents community data and
            indicators in a series of tables, charts and maps. Data comes from
            local, state, and federal government sources. Data are available by
            different geographies, from county and municipal levels down to
            neighborhood and census tract and block groupings. Not all
            information is available along all geographies, but much is.
